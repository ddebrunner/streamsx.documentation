# IBMStreams@github.com - Open Source Toolkits 
## Overview
If you're viewing this page, it's likely that you haven't worked with the Java Application API before, or possibly streaming applications in general. In this document, we discuss at a high level the general principles behind streaming application development and the benefits of the Java Application API, and  we demonstrate these in a sample application.

# Released Toolkits

These toolkits provide a release that is ready to be used in an SPL application.

To use download the tar archive from the project's releases page and then
unpack into a location you will include in your toolkit list when compiling
Streams applications. A common location is `$HOME/toolkits` or `project_root/toolkits` for shared environments.
